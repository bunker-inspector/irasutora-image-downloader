Downloads all images from irasutoya.com

Clear out ~2.5GB of disk space and run `java -jar irasutoya`, the `irasutoya` binary (still requires JVM installation) or for the enlightened, `irasutoya.core/-main` in the REPL. Images should be written to the `output` directory. You can use any SQLite client to read the `irasutoya.db` file left behind and read tag data or whatever.
